<h1>Stencil App Starter</h1>
<p>Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.</p>
<p>Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.  Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.</p>
<p>Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all. In many cases, Stencil can be used as a drop in replacement for traditional frontend frameworks given the capabilities now available in the browser, though using it as such is certainly not required.</p>
<p>Stencil also enables a number of key capabilities on top of Web Components, in particular Server Side Rendering (SSR) without the need to run a headless browser, pre-rendering, and objects-as-properties (instead of just strings).</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To start a new project using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm init stencil app
</code></pre>
<p>and run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm start
</code></pre>
<p>To build the app for production, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>To run the unit tests once, run:</p>
<pre><code>npm test
</code></pre>
<p>To run the unit tests and watch for file changes during development, run:</p>
<pre><code>npm run test.watch
</code></pre>
